It is designed to look (at the moment) only on HTTP requests (parameterized only!) and highlight specific information types. Currently, LookingGlass is hunting these particular data types:\r\n  - IMEI\r\n  - Credit Card numbers\r\n  - Locations\r\n  - IMSI\r\n  - MSISDN\r\n  - Longitudes & Latitudes\r\n  - Emails\r\n\r\nThe data is searched within encodings such cas `base64`, `urlencoding`, `base58` and we try to eliminate false-positives with searching if data might be data like `unix epoch time`.\r\n\r\nIt will create two artifacts after execution:\r\n\r\n  1. `filename.csv` - A CSV with all requests and parameters found, parsed.\r\n  2. `filename.html` - An HTML report only with the possible hits of patterns described above.\r\n\r\nA note for lazy - here is a 'help' with all arguments:\r\n```\r\n-f, --file           Single file mode. Path to PCAP file.\r\n-d, --directory      Directory to scan PCAPs in.\r\n-l, --live           Run on a live adapter and sniff. (not recommended)\r\n-v, --verbose        Show more information while running.\r\n-u, --user           User configurations to search.\r\n-h, --help           Shows this help menu.\r\n--falpos             Ignore data types that are not reliable such as MSISDN.\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Little Comment* - Because we get to record directly on devices sometimes, and on Android the recorder does not add the IP layer, we have added support for that as well.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nIt's acutally kinda straightforward. Just go into this folder with a terminal (assuming Linux/OSX) and with pip run:\r\n```bash\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Execution Types\r\n### Single\r\nRunning the script on 1 PCAP file. Example of usage will be:\r\n```bash\r\nlooking_glass.py -f 'FILENAME.pcap'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Folder Run\r\nRunning the script against several PCAPs within a single directory. Please notice that due to the laziness of the authors we are only searching for files with a .pcap extension.\r\n\r\nUsage example:\r\n```bash\r\nlooking_glass.py -d 'DIRECTORY'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Customized Search\r\nCreate a file of your choosing and add the terms you want to search. For string search just add:\r\n```\r\nnormal, SM-J700, Device Model\r\n```\r\nThe `'normal'` means text search, the `'SM-J700'` is the string to search and the `'Device Model'` is the title for that search. Please notice that LookingGlass will attempt to search for the data in binary form as well as in different encodings such as Base64 and so on.\r\n\r\nAnother type of search is a regex search. For example:\r\n```\r\nregex, (com\\.([a-zA-z]+\\.){1,3}[a-zA-z]+), Android Package Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also binary data search:\r\n```\r\nbinary, 0363646e0377, Binary User Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd Hash searches:\r\n```\r\nmd5hash, abc, MD5 of Name\r\nsha1hash, text_here, SHA1 of name\r\nsha256, text_here, SHA256 of name\r\nsha512, text_here, SHA512 of name\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you have saved the file you can call it like this:\r\n```bash\r\npython looking_glass.py -f pcap_file.pcap -u user_search.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## License - GPLv3\r\n[Yuval tisf Nativ](https://www.github.com/yitsf), [Dagan Pasternak](https://www.github.com/daganp)\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
